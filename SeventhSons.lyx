Informally they are called the Seventh Sons, not being the seventh of one

At a glance, with a moments concentration the seventh son knows the current
 Integrity or Equivalent of the target.
 If the target does not have a Integrity rating, the seventh son knows what
 it measures instead (if anything).
 If the target is supernatural, and is using an ability which masks that
 fact, then this triggers a Clash of Wills.
 If the Seventh Son fails, then he does not know that the target does not
 have a Integrity rating, but does know its current value.

\begin_layout Standard
They do not have to confess or make amends, and no longer feel guilty over
 that particular event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They gain the

\emph default
 towards the Seventh Son.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While under the effects of the condition they can not see anything the Seventh
 Son does as bad or problematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could for example start a barfight, or break into a building and the
 character wouldn't think to call the police.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Vindicated Condition is resolved when the suffering character next needs
 to make a breaking point roll (whether or not they succeed).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the effects of Succeeding, the Seventh Son may optionally
 remove that breaking point,

\begin_layout Standard
so that the target never feels guilt over it again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example if the target was guilty over a theft, by removing this breaking
 point, they would never again have to roll against integrity loss from
 theft.

Depending on their current Integrity this manifests in varying ways (and
 as they decline, the symptoms change):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
7-10: Obsessed with making amends: Normal restitution is not enough.
 If they stole a $100 watch, they must replace it with a $2,000 one, with
 fanfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 None must ever be aware of it.
 This will likely involve silencing any witnesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
0-2: Defined by their crime.
 In there minds that action they once felt guilt over, become their defining
 moment.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The target suffers gains the Crushing Guilt Condition, with the effect:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being reminded of the guilt is a breaking point for the target (once per
 scene).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If they suffer a breaking point for a similar reason to what caused the
 guilt they automatically fail, without rolling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extensive psychological counseling (and often medication), is the only way
 to resolve Crushing Guilt, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and that itself is almost certain to trigger a breaking point every session.
